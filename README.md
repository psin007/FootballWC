# System description
The Football World Cup is played between 4 teams. The teams are ranked from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating the highest ranking and 4 the lowest.
The Cup is played in two stages: Preliminary and Final.
<br/>
During the Preliminary stage, each team plays the other three teams resulting in a total of six (6)games played. The games during the Preliminary stage occur sequentially and the result of each game is shown on the screen as it is completed. In the Preliminary stage a team gains 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.
At the end of the Preliminary stage the system will display a summary of the results with the teams sorted from first to last, based on the following criteria:
<br/>
• The teams will be listed from most to least points.
<br/>
• If teams have the same points, then the team with the higher number of goals scored will
be placed higher on the table.
<br/>
• If teams cannot be separated by any of the previous criteria, then the higher placing in the
table will be determined randomly.
<br/>
After the Preliminary stage is completed, the top two teams play in the Final. The only difference
between the final and the preliminary games is that the final must have a winner, the Football
World Cup Champions!
<br/>
At the end of the Final the overall results are displayed on the screen, including the name of the
Football World Cup champion team, the Golden Boot Award player, and the Fair Play Award
team.
